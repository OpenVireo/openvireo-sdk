# Hosted accounts

`Account` is the entry point for anything a person does with their OpenVireo account: signing up and in,
unlocking, opening vaults, sharing. See [Concepts](../concepts.md) for what the keys and secrets are.

## Connecting

<!-- prelude
import { browserStorage } from "@openvireo/sdk";
-->
```ts
import { Account } from "@openvireo/sdk";

const account = await Account.connect({
  issuer: "https://accounts.openvireo.com",       // discovery: /.well-known/openvireo-configuration
  device: { name: "Firefox on Linux", platform: "web" },
  storage: browserStorage(),                        // where sessions and trusted-device keys live
});
```

`connect` reads the issuer's discovery document to find the account and sync servers, then loads a stored
session if `storage` has one. A resumed session is **signed in but locked** (`account.signedIn` is true,
`account.unlocked` false): the keys need the master password again.

`device.platform` is one of `web`, `cli`, `connect`, `qt-linux`, `qt-macos`, `qt-windows`, `ios`. The name shows up in
the user's device list.

### Storage

`storage` keeps the session (refresh token, device id), the trusted device's Secret Key, and each vault's sync
state. Pick one for the platform:

| Storage | Where | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `browserStorage()` | IndexedDB, encrypted with a non-extractable WebCrypto key | browsers |
| `new FileStorage(path)` from `@openvireo/sdk/storage/node` | a JSON file with mode 0600 | Node and Bun tools |
| `new MemoryStorage()` (the default) | memory | tests, one-off scripts |

Anything with `get`, `set` and `delete` (the `KeyValueStorage` interface) works, and `EncryptedStorage` wraps
another storage with an AES-GCM key you provide.

## Signing up

<!-- prelude
import type { Account } from "@openvireo/sdk";
declare const account: Account, email: string, password: string;
declare function showEmergencyKit(secretKey: string): void;
-->
```ts
const { secretKey, userId } = await account.register({ email, password });
showEmergencyKit(secretKey);   // the only time the Secret Key is shown; the user must keep it
```

`register` makes the Secret Key and keyset on the device, registers OPAQUE, and leaves the account signed in
and unlocked. With `trustDevice` (the default) this device keeps the Secret Key for next time. Later,
`account.secretKey()` returns the kept copy, so the user can download the Emergency Kit again.

## Signing in

<!-- prelude
import type { Account } from "@openvireo/sdk";
declare const account: Account, email: string, password: string, secretKey: string;
declare function askForCode(): Promise<string>;
-->
```ts
await account.login({
  email,
  password,
  secretKey,                     // only needed the first time on this device
  totp: () => askForCode(),      // asked only when the account has two-factor authentication on
});
```

`totp` can be a code or a function, which is called again (with `attempt` and the last `error`) when a code
is wrong. A missing code throws `mfa_required`, too many wrong ones `mfa_expired`.

Without `secretKey` on a device that doesn't trust this account yet, `login` throws `invalid_secret_key`: ask
for the Secret Key and try again. Pass `trustDevice: false` on shared computers.

## Unlocking and locking

<!-- prelude
import type { Account } from "@openvireo/sdk";
declare const account: Account, password: string;
-->
```ts
if (account.signedIn && !account.unlocked) await account.unlock(password);

account.lock();             // wipes the keys from memory; the session stays
await account.logout();     // ends the session on the server and forgets it here
await account.logout({ forgetDevice: true });   // also forgets the trusted Secret Key
```

`unlock` needs no OPAQUE round trip: it unwraps the keyset with the password and the kept Secret Key.

### Staying unlocked across a page reload

A web app loses its memory on every reload. To unlock again without the master password, seal the
unlocked keyset under a non-extractable WebCrypto key and keep the two apart: the key in IndexedDB, the
sealed string somewhere that ends with the tab, such as `sessionStorage`.

<!-- prelude
import type { Account } from "@openvireo/sdk";
declare const account: Account, reloaded: Account;
declare function saveKey(key: CryptoKey): Promise<void>;
declare function loadKey(): Promise<CryptoKey>;
-->
```ts
const key = await crypto.subtle.generateKey({ name: "AES-GCM", length: 256 }, false, ["encrypt", "decrypt"]);
await saveKey(key);
sessionStorage.setItem("unlocked", await account.sealUnlocked(key));

// after the reload, on a connected (signed-in, locked) account
const sealed = sessionStorage.getItem("unlocked");
if (sealed) await reloaded.resumeUnlocked(sealed, await loadKey());
```

The seal is bound to this issuer and user. `resumeUnlocked` checks the unsealed keys against the account's
public keys (from `/me`, or offline the cached profile). It fails with `signed_out` when the session has
ended, `decryption_failed` for a seal the key can't open, and `invalid_public_keys` when the account's keys
changed (an account reset). `lock()` doesn't revoke a seal, so delete the string and the key when your app
locks.

The session can also end on its own: when the refresh token expires, is revoked from another device, or is
used twice (`token_reused`, a sign of a stolen token). Listen for it:

<!-- prelude
import type { Account } from "@openvireo/sdk";
declare const account: Account;
declare function showSignIn(): void;
-->
```ts
const stop = account.onSignedOut((reason) => {   // "session_expired" | "token_reused" | "unauthorized" | "logout"
  showSignIn();
});
```

## The account itself

<!-- prelude
import type { Account } from "@openvireo/sdk";
declare const account: Account, current: string, next: string, code: string, password: string;
-->
```ts
account.email;          // the signed-in email
account.userId;
account.fingerprint;    // this account's public key fingerprint, for others to compare

await account.changePassword({ current, next });                  // signs the other devices out
await account.requestEmailChange("new@example.com");              // mails a code to the new address
await account.changeEmail({ email: "new@example.com", code, password });

const url = await account.webSessionUrl("/settings");   // a one-time link into the account website (60 s)
```

Changing the password keeps the same Secret Key and keyset, so vaults and shares keep working.

### Deleting the account

Deleting is scheduled (SPEC §23): the account is locked at once and erased after a grace period (30 days on
the hosted service), when its personal vaults, keys and billing go too. Until then the user can sign in and
restore it.

<!-- prelude
import type { Account } from "@openvireo/sdk";
declare const account: Account, password: string, typedEmail: string, bobPrincipal: `user:${string}`;
-->
```ts
const preview = await account.deletionPreview();
preview.eraseOn;     // when it would be erased
preview.vaults;      // { id, name, sharedWith }: shared vaults can be given away first
preview.orgs;        // outcome "leave", "delete" (deleted with the account) or "blocked"
if (preview.vaults[0]?.sharedWith.length) await account.transferVault(preview.vaults[0].id, bobPrincipal);

const { scheduledFor } = await account.deleteAccount({ password, confirm: typedEmail });
// This device is signed out (onSignedOut reports "deletion_scheduled") and its offline cache is gone.
// The Secret Key stays so the user can sign in again and restore:
if (account.deletionScheduledFor) await account.restoreAccount({ password });
```

- A `blocked` org is one where the user is the only confirmed owner and others are in it. `deleteAccount`
  fails with `deletion_blocked` until the user makes one of `members` an owner (`setMemberRole`; admins
  need no new keys) or deletes the org.
- Signed in to a pending account, `deletionScheduledFor` is the erase date and every vault call fails with
  `account_pending_deletion`. Show a screen with Restore and Sign out.
- Other signed-in devices hear `deletion_scheduled` on the event stream and are signed out the same way.
- Keep the date with your remembered-accounts list (SPEC §21) and remove the account, with
  `forgetDevice`, once `deletionExpired(date)` is true.

The lower-level `account.auth` (an `AuthClient`) covers every account server route, for things `Account` has no
helper for, such as the device list and two-factor setup:

<!-- prelude
import type { Account } from "@openvireo/sdk";
declare const account: Account;
-->
```ts
const { devices } = await account.auth.listDevices();   // name, platform, last_seen_at, current, …
const old = devices.find((d) => !d.current && d.name === "Old laptop");
if (old) await account.auth.revokeDevice(old.id);
```
